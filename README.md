# WordGuessGame
## What the project does
This project is a version of the hangman game without the graphics of a hangman. It listens for user input after the user selects start new game. It will tell the user if they guessed a letter already as well as telling the user if their input wasn't valid. If valid input was put in the computer will sort it into the correct category and show the letter in the word or put it into the array for letters not in the word. The game will restart when either lives run out or the word is completely filled in. The information on the screen is put there dynamically using jQuery.
